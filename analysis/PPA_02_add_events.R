## This script does the following:
# 1. Import multiple-event-per-person long format dataset (df_months, which originates from data_processed.arrow)
# 2. Import the additional dataset with stable and dynamic time-updated covariates needed for the per-protocol analysis (data_processed_ppa.arrow -> df_ppa)
# 3. Assign treatment to df_months
# 4. Merge the stable time-updated (first-ever, constant) covariates from df_ppa to df_months. To test edge cases, further adapt dummy data.
# 5. Assign the stable time-updated (first-ever, constant) in df_months. 
# 6. Reformatting of the dynamic time-updated covariates in a long-format df_ppa, before merging to df_months. To test edge cases, further adapt dummy data.
# 7. Merge and assign the dynamic time-updated covariates from df_ppa to df_months.
# 8. Fill up the Swiss cheese and reassign the lipid ratio and other categorical variables
# 9. Drop unnecessary helper variables created along the way
# 10. Assign and shift outcomes, competing, and censoring events

print('Assign treatment to df_months')
## Definition: Assign treatment status in interval k based on the latest treatment initiation recorded within that same interval. 
## Rationale: Treatment is the focal point of each interval; no lagging or leading is necessary for its definition.

### Moreover, we assume someone stays on treatment once is initiated, i.e., first-ever, time-fixed event 
### Moreover, here, we have defined treatment at baseline already (exp_bin_treat), we only assign treatment in control to flag those who initiate during follow-up (cens_date_metfin_start_cont)
### I can use my preexisting function, which works perfectly for this, based on these rules:
# a) if event date is not NA and happened before the minimum start date of all intervals of a person, then assign 1 (in corresponding flag variable) to all person-intervals
# b) if event date is not NA and happened after the maximum end date of all intervals of a person, then assign 0 (in corresponding flag variable) to all person-intervals
# c) if no event date is recorded (date variable == NA), then assign 0 (in corresponding flag variable) to all person-intervals (assuming no documentation = no event)
# d) if event date happened during follow-up, then assign 1 (in corresponding flag variable) to corresponding person-interval, and 0 to all person-intervals before, and 1 to all person-intervals after (stable/time-fixed event)

# I only have treatment starting date data from the control group. 
# But adding this extra step I get the overall time-varying "treat" variable for both groups (always treat = 1 in intervention)
# My PP question is: "starting metformin monotherapy (within 6 months of T2D diagnosis) vs never starting metformin" and since all those who did not start metformin are assigned to control, only the control group can deviate from protocol. This PP question/estimand also means we are not interested in what is happening after initiation (all subsequent "treat" rows are assigned 1 once initiated)

# There are two types of time-updated covariates:
## a) stable time-updated (first-ever, constant) covariates: E.g. new stroke diagnosis, or new CKD diagnosis during follow-up
### These are stable over time, we only track the first ever occurring and then a person has it -> "0" in before the event, "1" after it happened
### These are simple to assign, do not require a long-format (event-level) dataset, and (in our case) make up a big share of the time-updated covariates
### Hence, deal with them first in a simple and efficient way
## b) dynamic time-update covariates: E.g. Hba1c, BMI, lipids (of course something like smoking could feature here as well, we ignore this for now)
### These are dynamic over time, may increase/decrease, in the person-interval dataset we carry over the last value until something new is happening
### These are more complex to assign, we need event-level dataset and work with them in a long format dataset until we have reduced them to 1 measurement (the correct one! see rules) per person/interval
### Once done, we merge them to the main person-month dataset with all other variables. But work on them in a separate long format dataset for as long as possible to be efficient.

# it will result in a dataset with "cov_bin_* (comorbidities)" as baseline indicators and "cov_date_* (comorbidities)" for the stable one-time time-updated (first-ever, constant) covariate
# Ignore the "cov_bin_* (comorbidities)" from df_months since "cov_date_* (comorbidities)" from df_ppa was constructed as minimmum of first ever (see dataset_definition_ppa.py). It would have been cleaner to do this directly in df_months - if we would have know about the PPA from the start.

# 5. Assign the stable time-updated (first-ever, constant) covariates --------
print('Assign the stable time-updated (first-ever, constant) covariates')
## Definition: Assign covariate status for interval k using latest covariate information before treatment status in interval k. 
## If no covariate status update before treatment status in interval k or no treatment status update, then carry over the latest covariate information from interval kâˆ’1.
## Rationale: This ensures that covariate information temporally precedes treatment assignment and in general reflects the latest available information at the start of interval k.

### Use a function with the following rules:
# First step:
# a) if covariate date (e.g. cov_date_ami) is not NA and happened before the minimum start date of all intervals of a person, then assign 1 (in corresponding flag variable) to all person-intervals
# b) if covariate date is not NA and happened after the maximum end date of all intervals of a person, then assign 0 (in corresponding flag variable) to all person-intervals
# c) if covariate date is NA, then assign 0 (in corresponding flag variable) to all person-intervals (assuming no documentation = no event)
# d) if covariate date is a date that happened during follow-up, then assign 1 (in flag variable) to next person-interval (using lag), 0 to all person-intervals before (incl. the current person-interval), and 1 to all person-intervals after (stable/time-fixed event)
## CAVE: This will now overwrite the preexisting cov_bin_ variables from the main dataset, which is fine (see comment above), but just to be aware of
# Second step:
# e) if covariate date is a date that happened during follow-up, check if this date is in same interval as the censoring event (cens_date_metfin_start_cont, i.e. started treatment in control group) and 
# if it happened on or before cens_date_metfin_start_cont, then assign 1 (in cov flag variable) to the current (not only next) person-interval. Otherwise, keep all as it is.

# Now, if there are several of the same dynamic time-updated covariate events happening in the same interval/month (e.g. HbA1c several times recorded/measured in same month):
## => carefully choose the relevant one, according to the following rules, taking our treatment information change/update variable (cens_date_metfin_start_cont) into account: 
### a) If cov_date is in same interval as cens_date_metfin_start_cont and cov_date > cens_date_metfin_start_cont, then flag the one closest to end_date_month to be moved to the next month (and discard the others that are in same interval as cens_date_metfin_start_cont & with cov_date > cens_date_metfin_start_cont)
### b) If cov_date is in same interval as cens_date_metfin_start_cont and cov_date <= cens_date_metfin_start_cont, then flag the one on or closest to cens_date_metfin_start_cont to keep (and discard the others that are also in same interval as cens_date_metfin_start_cont & cov_date <= cens_date_metfin_start_cont)
#### If at the same time, there were also cov_date > cens_date_metfin_start_cont in same interval, they will have been dealt with in rule (a) already
### c) If cov_date is not in same interval as cens_date_metfin_start_cont, then flag the one closest to end_date_month to be moved to the next month (and discard all others)
### d) Then, shift all covariate info flagged as "move" to the next month, while keeping all flagged as "keep" in the original month

##### Then, deal with edge cases: 
### (i) We may have months whereby we moved a covariate due to rule (c) or rule (a) into a month with a "keep" covariate (rule b) => >1 covariate info update in same person-interval
#### => Solution: "keep" beats "move", i.e., the one that was flagged as "keep" (because it contains time-update covariate info JUST before treatment change) is more important and wins
##### Side-note: In our case, we only have treatment update once, so a move due to rule (a) ending up in a month with a "keep" covariate (rule b) is not possible - but the function/rules work with more complex dynamic treatment updates, too!
### (ii) We may have the scenario whereby treatment update info and covariate update info change on same date (and no time-stamp to differentiate)
#### => Solution: Regard these covariate info as measured BEFORE treatment info change (see rule b above). Alternatively (sensitivity analyses), simply adapt rule a and b to regard them as measured AFTER treatment info change

##### NOTE: This function defines what to do with all OBSERVED covariate info (and to select to correct one in the correct interval). For all UNOBSERVED covariate in between we use "fill forward" (see below -> filling up the Swiss cheese), but only after merging to the existing monthly-interval dataset.
##### At the end, this results in only 1 covariate info update per person-interval for each measurement (BMI, lipids, HbA1c)

# 10. Assign and shift outcome, censoring due to LTFU and competing events --------
print('Assign and shift outcome, censoring due to LTFU, and competing events')
# CAVE: use it only after the dataset has been interval-expanded (fn_expand_intervals.R) and after all events have been added (fn_assign* functions)

# Define columns called "outcome", censor_LTFU", "comp_event"
# Shift them as follows:

## a) outcome is happening in CURRENT (k + 1) interval:
### i) assign to CURRENT (k + 1) row/person-interval: outcome=NA, censor_LTFU=NA, comp_event=NA
### ii) assign to the PREVIOUS (k) row/person-interval: outcome=1, censor_LTFU=0, comp_event=0

## b) censor_LTFU is happening in CURRENT (k + 1) interval:
### i) assign to CURRENT (k + 1) row/person-interval: outcome=NA, censor_LTFU=NA, comp_event=NA
### ii) assign to the PREVIOUS (k) row/person-interval: outcome=NA, censor_LTFU=1, comp_event=NA # I still think it is possible to replace all NA with 0 without making any difference, since the outcome model is restricted to only rows with df_months[df_months$censor==0 & df_months$comp_event == 0,], but need to check. This is how Miguel's data set is set up, maybe it will have a reason later on, e.g. when looking at competing events. TBD

## c) comp_event is happening in CURRENT (k + 1) interval:
### i) assign to CURRENT (k + 1) row/person-interval: outcome=NA, censor_LTFU=NA, comp_event=NA
### ii) assign to the PREVIOUS (k) row/person-interval : outcome=NA, censor_LTFU=0, comp_event=1 # same comment re NA as above

## Edge case RULES
### d) if outcome and censor_LTFU have the EXACT same date, then pick the outcome as the defining event. Ensured by case_when() order in function.
### e) if outcome and competing event (i.e. non-covid death) event have the EXACT same date, then pick the outcome as the defining event. Ensured by case_when() order in function.
### f) if censoring and competing event event have the EXACT same date, then pick the competing event as the defining event. Ensured by case_when() order in function.

## Then, delete all rows/person-intervals with NAs in all three variables (outcome & censor_LTFU & comp_event), i.e., the person-interval the event happened (and by doing this, this also drops the covariate/eligibility/treatment info from that interval)
## This is the reason, why it needs a dataset per outcome, because the datasets will have different lengths. Alternatively tell the model to ignore info happening after outcome of interest (even if there is data afterwards), but I think this is cleaner, easier and safer.
